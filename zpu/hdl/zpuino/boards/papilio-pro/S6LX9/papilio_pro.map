Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                 1,092 out of   1,430   76%
  Nummber of MUXCYs used:                      792 out of   2,860   27%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:        3,495

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
